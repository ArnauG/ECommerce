[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/ArnauG/ECommerce.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/ArnauG/ECommerce)

This repository is to practice with kotlin collection API

In this example we are going to mock an ECommerce application and implement some
features using the Kotlin collection API

## Features

1. Find all products that have not been ordered yet.
2. Find all eager customers, all those customers that had bought more than n(as function argument) products.
3. Find all the products, those were bought more than once for a given customer.
4. Find all smart customers, all those customers that bought more products with discount than products without it.
